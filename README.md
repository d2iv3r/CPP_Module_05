# C++ Module 05:

## Overview

In this module, we will explore the concept of **Exceptions** in C++, an important feature for handling errors in a clean and controlled manner. Exceptions provide a way to separate error-handling code from regular program logic, making your programs more robust and easier to maintain. You'll learn how to use the `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords to handle exceptions, create custom exceptions, and manage error flow in your applications.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Introduction to Exceptions**
- What **exceptions** are and why they are important in modern C++ programming.
- The basics of the exception-handling mechanism in C++.
- Understanding the flow of program control when an exception is thrown and caught.

### 2. **Try, Catch, and Throw**
- The **try** block: How to enclose code that might throw an exception.
- The **catch** block: How to catch and handle exceptions that occur in the try block.
- The **throw** keyword: How to throw an exception from a function or method.
- Syntax and structure of a basic `try-catch` block.
- How to catch different types of exceptions and use exception handlers.

### 3. **Standard Exceptions**
- The **standard exception classes** provided by C++: `std::exception`, `std::runtime_error`, `std::logic_error`, etc.
- How to use standard exceptions to handle common error scenarios.
- Best practices for throwing and catching standard exceptions.

### 4. **Custom Exceptions**
- How to define custom exception classes in C++.
- Creating a class hierarchy for custom exceptions.
- How to throw and catch custom exceptions in your code.
- Best practices for implementing and using custom exceptions.

### 5. **Exception Propagation**
- Understanding how exceptions propagate through function calls.
- How to control exception propagation with the `throw` keyword.
- The role of exception safety in preventing memory leaks or undefined behavior during exception handling.

### 6. **Exception Safety Levels**
- Understanding the different levels of **exception safety** (basic, strong, and no-throw guarantee).
- How to ensure that your code is exception-safe and does not introduce bugs or resource leaks.
- Techniques for writing exception-safe code (e.g., using RAII â€“ Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
